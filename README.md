## Installation
### Cloning the Repo
1. `git clone <repo>`
2. `git lfs install` to initialize lfs hooks. 
3. `git pull` should pull from the LFS repository but `git lfs pull` will fill in any missing content. 

### Opening the Project in Unity
This project was built using Unity LTS version **2022.3.9f1**. Open the project with the same version 
since Unity dislikes running mismatched project and engine versions.
